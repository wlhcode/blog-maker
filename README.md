# About
Blog Maker is a simple tool to convert your TXT files into a nice lightweight HTML blog. You are more than welcome to change the layout of your blog. The release is for Windows only, but you can compile `prog.cpp` yourself for other systems. You may view an example made with Blog Maker [here](https://wlhcode.github.io/blog-maker/example/).
